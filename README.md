# Magic Leap Floor Detection ![stability-wip](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-work_in_progress-lightgrey.svg)

Detect and display the floor in Magic Leap Unity projects with this expansion to the ML SDK Meshing example scene.

## Dependencies

* Lumin SDK v0.20.0.
* Magic Leap UnityÂ® Package v0.20.0.
* Unity 2019.1.5f1 with Lumin OS (Magic Leap) Build Support.

It will likely work in other versions of Unity 2019, but I make no guarantees. ðŸ˜Ž

## How to Use

All Magic Leap code and content is .gitignored so as to abide by the terms of the Independent Creator Program.

To use this example, either (in order of simplicity):

1. Import [MagicLeapFloorDetection.unitypackage](https://github.com/davidfoster/magic-leap-floor-detection/blob/develop/Packages/MagicLeapFloorDetection.unitypackage) into an existing ML Unity project.
   * Make sure the API Compatibility Level under _Project Settings > Player > Other Settings_ is set to **.NET 4x**. Sorry if this is annoying; I'm now addicted to that deliciously sweet C# 7 syntactic sugar.
2. Import the ML Unity package included with the SDK into the project under [_Projects/MagicLeapFloorDetection_](https://github.com/davidfoster/magic-leap-floor-detection/blob/develop/Projects/MagicLeapFloorDetection), then import ML Remote support libraries ("_Magic Leap > ML Remote > Import Support Libraries_" menu item inside of Unity).
   * Make sure the Lumin platform is active in Build Settings or you will receive a "No ML VRDevice loaded" error.

## Examples

In these examples, vertices are rendered in yellow whose normals fall within a specified degree delta of the floor normal. Of those vertices, those who fall below the detected floor y are considered to be a part of the floor, and are rendered in green.

By default, the degree delta is `20`Â° and the floor normal is world `Vector3.up`. The rendered detected floor y also includes an error margin (default: `0.05`) to envelop noise in the spatial map which falls just above the de facto detected floor y but should still be considered a part of the floor.
