# Magic Leap Floor Detection ![stability-wip](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-work_in_progress-lightgrey.svg)

Detect and display the floor in Magic Leap Unity projects with this expansion to the ML SDK Meshing example scene.

## Dependencies

* Lumin SDK v0.20.0.
* Magic Leap UnityÂ® Package v0.20.0.
* Unity 2019.1.5f1 with Lumin OS (Magic Leap) Build Support.

It will likely work in other versions of Unity 2019, but I make no guarantees. ðŸ˜Ž

## How to Use

All Magic Leap code and content is .gitignored so as to abide by the terms of the Independent Creator Program.

To use this example, either (in order of simplicity):

1. Import [MagicLeapFloorDetection.unitypackage](https://github.com/davidfoster/magic-leap-floor-detection/blob/develop/Packages/MagicLeapFloorDetection.unitypackage) into an existing ML Unity project.
2. Import the ML Unity package included with the SDK into the project under [_Projects/MagicLeapFloorDetection_](https://github.com/davidfoster/magic-leap-floor-detection/blob/develop/Projects/MagicLeapFloorDetection), then import ML Remote support libraries ("_Magic Leap > ML Remote > Import Support Libraries_" menu item inside of Unity).
   * Make sure the Lumin platform is active in Build Settings or you will receive a "No ML VRDevice loaded" error.
